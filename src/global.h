 * both are used. dev represents an index / identifier of a device or
 * filesystem, and I'm unsure whether a negative value has any meaning in that
 * context. Hence my choice of using an unsigned integer. Negative values, if
 * we encounter them, will just get typecasted into a positive value. No
 * information is lost in this conversion, and the semantics remain the same.
