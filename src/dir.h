 * follows:
 *
 * Input:
 *   Responsible for getting a directory structure into ncdu. Will call the
 *   Output functions for data and the UI functions for feedback. Currently
 *   there is only one input implementation: dir_scan.c
 * Output:
 *   Called by the Input handling code when there's some new file/directory
 *   information. The Output code is responsible for doing something with it
 *   and determines what action should follow after the Input is done.
 *   Currently there is only one output implementation: dir_mem.c.
 * Common:
 *   Utility functions and UI code for use by the Input handling code to draw
 *   progress/error information on the screen, handle any user input and misc.
 *   stuff.

   *   size, asize, ino, dev, flags (only DIR,FILE,ERR,OTHFS,EXL,HLNKC).

   * assumed to be set to something sensible.
