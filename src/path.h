 path.c reimplements realpath() and chdir(), both functions accept
 arbitrary long path names not limited by PATH_MAX.

 Caveats/bugs:
  - path_real uses chdir(), so it's not thread safe
  - Process requires +x access for all directory components
  - Potentionally slow
  - path_real doesn't check for the existance of the last component
  - cwd is unreliable after path_real
*/

/* path_real reimplements realpath(). The returned string is allocated
   by malloc() and should be manually free()d by the programmer. */
extern char *path_real(const char *);

/* works exactly the same as chdir() */
